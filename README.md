# webnews - a web-based newsreader

Some of the members of the
[Tokyo PC Users Group](http://tokyopc.org/) complained
that they couldn't access our local
[newsgroups](http://tokyopc.org/tpc/newsgroups.html)
through their firewall, so I put together a
[PCGI](http://starship.python.net/crew/jbauer/persistcgi/index.html)
program that queries the NNTP server and builds
[simple HTML pages](<http://www.tokyopc.org/cgi-bin/webnews/newsgroup?G=tpc.list)
on the fly.
